# VeraCrypt-Password-Sniffer
Here I have written the code for the VeraCrypt Password Sniffer.
The main objective here is to capture the user’s password(the password is used to mount the encrypted disk) in VeraCrypt.
So, for this, I built a trojan, which will extract the password, and then save it in the user’s system.
If you want to follow this properly, then please check the pdf file uploaded here

Thank You
